# Motive
During last year of high school, I found that Covid made it harder for Chinese high school students to make physical yearbooks because of physical contact constraint. So I built this Platform as a Service full-stack web app that focus on helping Chinese International High School students to create digital yearbooks by letting each student sign up their personal account and upload their profiles.

# Tech stack
- Built a responsive Frontend using HTML, Javascript, Bootstrap, and Figma design.
- Used Php, MySQL for user authentication, user registration, credential retrieval.
- Deployed on AWS EC2. AWS RDS for data storage.
- Integrated Google Map API to present studentsâ€™ university location.
