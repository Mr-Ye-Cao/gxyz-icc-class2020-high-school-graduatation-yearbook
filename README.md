During my high school senior year, I identified that Covid caused Chinese high school students difficulty making physical year book (due to physical contact constraint). So I bootstrapped this PaaS (Platform as a Service) full-stack web application that focus on Chinese International High School students to help them digitally create yearbooks by letting each students' portofolio on their own via personal account.
